1. Install Python 3: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Open CMD on Windows, and type: the language that we will use "python", the path where the script is and then the path where the images are. Use quotes to refer the paths.
i.e.: python "C:\Users\vinicius_n4\Downloads\photo_organizer.py" "C:\Users\vinic\OneDrive\Imagens\Imagens da CÃ¢mera"
